Before we dive into cool new things we are working on in arquillian ecosystem let's lay the ground and talk about microservices for a second.

Very popular these days even though not really new. Maybe the term is.

What really is a microservice?  These are small, autonomous components that work together. Preffered communication is over the network. 

It's essentially a piece of software which represents single concept from a given domain. For example: user registratrion or order status. 

Small and focused on doing one thing well.

But how small is small? Is it measured in lines of code?

Rule of thumb which I've seen in several books is that microservice can by "rewritten from scratch within 2 weeks". It's a bit questionable especially when service itself does quite heavy algorithmic work, but in principle it is a good measure to keep in mind.

* {point-label} Single Responsibility
* {point-label} Loosely Coupled
* {point-label} Deployed Independently

Single responsibility - It should does one thing and does it well. 

Loosely coupled - can be changed without affecting other parts of the system.

polyglot - you like scala, clojure, give it a try. it will obviously bring some challenges to the team but this is the beauty of our profession, that we can learn constantly.

Linux programs composed together are in fact conceptually similar or are even an inspiration for the microservices movement
